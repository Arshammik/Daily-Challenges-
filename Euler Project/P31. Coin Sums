# Coin Sums
# Problem Number 31


'''
In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence (p). There are eight coins in general circulation:

1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p).
It is possible to make £2 in the following way:

1*£1 + 1*50p + 2*20p + 1*5p + 1*2p + 3*1p
How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?

coins = [1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200]
routes = [1] + [0]*goal

for coin in coins:
    for i in range(coin, goal+1):
        routes[i] += routes[i-coin]

print (routes[goal])
