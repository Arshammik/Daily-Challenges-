# Number letter counts

'''
If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.

If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?

# It is redculess not to use a library for that
# Hence, we managed to use num2words

    for i in range(1, n+1):
        lenght += len(num2words(i).replace(" ","").replace("-",""))
    return total_length
